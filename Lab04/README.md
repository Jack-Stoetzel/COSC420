### What is the theoretical time complexity of your algorithms (best and worst case), in terms of the input size?

### According to the data, does adding more nodes perfectly divide the time taken by the program?
### Consider the problem of brute-forcing passwords under only maximum string length. How much time would it take to complete this hack, extrapolating from your measurements?
### What are some real-world software examples that would need the above routines? Why? Would they benefit greatly from using your distributed code?
### How could the code be improved in terms of usability, efficiency, and robustness?
